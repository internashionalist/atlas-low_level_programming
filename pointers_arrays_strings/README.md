0. 98 Battery st.
Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
	Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);

1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream
Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
	Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);

2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read
Write a function that returns the length of a string.
	Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);

3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
	Prototype: void _puts(char *str);

4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear
Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
	Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);

5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes
Write a function that reverses a string.
	Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);

6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true
Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
	Prototype: void puts2(char *str);

7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half
Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
	Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
	The function should print the second half of the string
	If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2

8. Arrays are not pointers
Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
	Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
	where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
	Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
	The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
	You are allowed to use printf

9. strcpy
Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
	Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
	Return value: the pointer to dest

10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers
Write a function that convert a string to an integer.
	Prototype: int _atoi(char *s);
	The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters
	You need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number
	If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0
	You are not allowed to use long
	You are not allowed to declare new variables of type array
	You are not allowed to hard-code special values
	We will use the -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow gcc flag to compile your code.

11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code
#advanced
Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
	You are allowed to use the standard library
	You dont have to pass the betty-style tests (you still need to pass the betty-doc tests)
	man srand, rand, time
	gdb and objdump can help








0. strcat
Write a function that concatenates two strings.
	Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
	This function appends the src string to the dest string, 
		overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
	Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

1. strncat
Write a function that concatenates two strings.
	Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
	The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
		it will use at most n bytes from src; and
		src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
	Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
