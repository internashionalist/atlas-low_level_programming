## More Info

### Files

#### The following are very important steps

  In the following tasks, we are going to use these files. We want to compile these only.
  You can either create the files of the repository into your project folder (makefiles) and copy paste their content from github OR you can clone the 0x1B.c repository into the makefiles folder.
  If youâ€™re going to clone it, you should enter the makefiles folder and inside this folder delete the .git folder using this command rm -rf .git then move the files from this folder into the makefiles folder to test your work.

## Tasks

0. make -f 0-Makefile

  Create your first Makefile.

  Requirements:

    name of the executable: school
    rules: all
      The all rule builds your executable
    variables: none

1. make -f 1-Makefile

  Requirements:

    name of the executable: school
    rules: all
      The all rule builds your executable
    variables: CC, SRC
      CC: the compiler to be used
      SRC: the .c files

2. make -f 2-Makefile

  Create your first useful Makefile.

  Requirements:

    name of the executable: school
    rules: all
      The all rule builds your executable
    variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME
      CC: the compiler to be used
      SRC: the .c files
      OBJ: the .o files
      NAME: the name of the executable
    The all rule should recompile only the updated source files
    You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files

3. make -f 3-Makefile

  Requirements:

    name of the executable: school
    rules: all, clean, oclean, fclean, re
      all: builds your executable
      clean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
      oclean: deletes the object files
      fclean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
      re: forces recompilation of all source files
    variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME, RM
      CC: the compiler to be used
      SRC: the .c files
      OBJ: the .o files
      NAME: the name of the executable
      RM: the program to delete files
    The all rule should recompile only the updated source files
    The clean, oclean, fclean, re rules should never fail
    You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files

4. A complete Makefile

  Requirements:

    name of the executable: school
    rules: all, clean, fclean, oclean, re
      all: builds your executable
      clean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
      oclean: deletes the object files
      fclean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
      re: forces recompilation of all source files
    variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME, RM, CFLAGS
      CC: the compiler to be used
      SRC: the .c files
      OBJ: the .o files
      NAME: the name of the executable
      RM: the program to delete files
      CFLAGS: your favorite compiler flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
    The all rule should recompile only the updated source files
    The clean, oclean, fclean, re rules should never fail

    You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files
