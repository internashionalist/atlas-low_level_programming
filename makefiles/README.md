- what is `make` and  makefiles
- when, why and how to use Makefiles
- what are rules and how to set and use them
- what are explicit and implicit rules
- what are the most common / useful rules
- what are variables and how to set and use them

## More Info

### Files

#### The following are very important steps

- In the following tasks, we are going to use [these](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x1B.c) files. We want to compile these only.
- You can either create the files of the repository into your project folder (makefiles) and copy paste their content from github OR you can clone the 0x1B.c repository into the makefiles folder.
- If youâ€™re going to clone it, you should enter the makefiles folder and inside this folder delete the .git folder using this command rm -rf .git then move the files from this folder into the makefiles folder to test your work.

## Tasks

0. make -f 0-Makefile

- Create your first Makefile.

    Requirements:

  - name of the executable: school
  - rules: all
    - The all rule builds your executable
  - variables: none

1. make -f 1-Makefile

    Requirements:

    - name of the executable: school
    - rules: all
      - The all rule builds your executable
    - variables: CC, SRC
      - CC: the compiler to be used
      - SRC: the .c files

2. make -f 2-Makefile

- Create your first useful Makefile.

    Requirements:

  - name of the executable: school
  - rules: all
    - The all rule builds your executable
  - variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME
    - CC: the compiler to be used
    - SRC: the .c files
    - OBJ: the .o files
    - NAME: the name of the executable
  - The all rule should recompile only the updated source files
  - You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files

3. make -f 3-Makefile

    Requirements:

    - name of the executable: school
    - rules: all, clean, oclean, fclean, re
      - all: builds your executable
      - clean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
      - oclean: deletes the object files
      - fclean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
      - re: forces recompilation of all source files
    - variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME, RM
      - CC: the compiler to be used
      - SRC: the .c files
      - OBJ: the .o files
      - NAME: the name of the executable
      - RM: the program to delete files
    - The all rule should recompile only the updated source files
    - The clean, oclean, fclean, re rules should never fail
    - You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files

4. A complete Makefile

    Requirements:

    - name of the executable: school
    - rules: all, clean, fclean, oclean, re
      - all: builds your executable
      - clean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
      - oclean: deletes the object files
      - fclean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
      - re: forces recompilation of all source files
    - variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME, RM, CFLAGS
      - CC: the compiler to be used
      - SRC: the .c files
      - OBJ: the .o files
      - NAME: the name of the executable
      - RM: the program to delete files
      - CFLAGS: your favorite compiler flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
    - The all rule should recompile only the updated source files
    - The clean, oclean, fclean, re rules should never fail
    - You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files
